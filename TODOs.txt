List of TODOs that need implementing:

	Bugs:
		- need a CHARLIT for assignment --> char x = 'h'
		- mixed type comparisons and operations

	Necessities:

		- list, arrays, and structs
			- need to implement function calls in scanner, parser, and semant
			- need to implement functionality in c++
			- literals to be implemented
		- gradual typing system
		- range loop that handles start index and step size

	If time permits:

		- implement ** (exponent) operator in parser
		- higher order functions


Next Steps:

	1) test basic code as it currently stands and fix bugs
		- Goal completion: Tuesday, May 5
	2) once basics are working, add lists and structs with c++
		- Goal completion: Thursday May 7
	3) add gradual typing system
		- Goal completion: Thursday, May 14
