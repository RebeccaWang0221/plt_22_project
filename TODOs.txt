List of TODOs that need implementing:

	Current:
		- array literals
		- for loop char in string

	Bugs:
		- if_end block does not get terminator when inside of a function so an error occurs, only problematic if there
		  is an else
				- *** fixed this but need to note that if no return statement at end or no else with return then it returns default value
		- fix the warnings ** FIX LAST
