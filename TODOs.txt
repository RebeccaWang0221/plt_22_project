List of TODOs that need implementing:
	- list, arrays, and structs
		- need to handle in scanner, parser, and semant
		- need to implement functionality in c++
	- implement ** (exponent) operator in parser
		- keeps reporting shift/reduce conflicts for some reason
	- irgen stage
	- fix bug where error is raised if there is a return in an if statement inside of a function definition
		e.g. def int foo(int x) {
			     if x < 5 {
			         return x;
			     }
			     return 1;
			 }
