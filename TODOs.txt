List of TODOs that need implementing:
	- list, arrays, and structs
		- need to handle in scanner, parser, and semant
		- need to implement functionality in c++
	- implement ** (exponent) operator in parser (This seems to have been resolved)
		- keeps reporting shift/reduce conflicts for some reason
	- irgen stage
		- fill in TODOs
		- need to initialize builder object

Questions:
	- How to implement local and global variables given our program is defined as a list of stmts?
		- Python doesn't allow you to re-declare a variable w/ same name inside of a function definition, so should we allow this?
	- add_terminal in microc?
	- basic blocks?
		- specifically in control flow statements
