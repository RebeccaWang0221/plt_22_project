List of TODOs that need implementing:

	Next Steps:
		1) test basic code as it currently stands and fix bugs
			- Goal completion: Tuesday, May 5 (Completed)
		2) once basics are working, add lists and structs with c++
			- Goal completion: Thursday May 7
		3) add gradual typing system
			- Goal completion: Thursday, May 14

	Bugs:
		- need to implement string/char equality and inequality
		- if_end block does not get terminator when inside of a function so an error occurs, only problematic if there
		  is an else
		- fix the warnings

	Questions:
		- How to implement string/char equality and inequality?

	Tests Passed:
		- test_while.rs
		- test_range.rs
		- test_comparisons_and_ifs.rs
		- test_comments.rs
		- test_cal_float.rs
		- test_cal_bool.rs
		- fail_type_mixed.rs
		- fail_type_mixed2.rs
		- fail_assign.rs
		- fail_assign2.rs
		- test_cal_int.rs

	Tests Failed:
		- test_cal_string.rs
				- need to implement == and != for strings and chars

	Not yer tested:
		- test_for.rs
		- test_cont.rs
		- test_break.rs

	Necessities:
		- list, arrays, and structs
			- need to implement function calls in scanner, parser, and semant
			- need to implement functionality in c++
			- literals to be implemented
		- gradual typing system
		- range loop that handles start index and step size

	If time permits:
		- implement ** (exponent) operator in parser
		- higher order functions
